# pycauset.eigvals

This function is currently not available.

The legacy complex/eigendecomposition subsystem was removed. Eigenvalue APIs will return once the new complex dtype system is implemented.

Alternatives: `MatrixBase.trace()`, `MatrixBase.determinant()`, and `pycauset.invert()` (where applicable).
