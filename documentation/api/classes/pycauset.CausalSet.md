# pycauset.CausalSet

```python
class CausalSet(n, spacetime=None, seed=None)
```

The `CausalSet` class (aliased as `Causet`) represents a causal set generated by sprinkling points into a spacetime manifold. It uses a memory-efficient "stateless" sprinkling algorithm that allows for the generation of extremely large causal sets (billions of elements) without storing the coordinates of the points in RAM.

## Parameters

*   **n** (*int*): The number of elements (points) to sprinkle.
*   **spacetime** (*CausalSpacetime, optional*): The spacetime manifold to sprinkle into. If `None`, defaults to a 2-dimensional Minkowski Diamond.
*   **seed** (*int, optional*): The random seed for the sprinkling process. If `None`, a random seed is generated.

## Properties

### CausalMatrix

```python
@property
def CausalMatrix(self) -> TriangularBitMatrix
```

(Alias: `C`)

Returns the causal matrix of the set. This is the primary "product" of the `CausalSet` instance. It is a `TriangularBitMatrix` where `M[i, j] = 1` if element `i` causally precedes element `j` ($i \prec j$), and 0 otherwise.

**Storage Note**: The `CausalSet` instance itself is very lightweight. It stores only the metadata ($N$, seed, spacetime definition) and a handle to this matrix. The matrix itself is backed by a file on disk (memory-mapped), so creating a `CausalSet` does not load the entire structure into RAM. The coordinates of the sprinkled points are **not** stored; they are generated transiently to compute this matrix and then discarded.

### n

```python
@property
def n(self) -> int
```

The number of elements in the causal set.

### spacetime

```python
@property
def spacetime(self) -> CausalSpacetime
```

The spacetime manifold object used for sprinkling.

## Methods

### \_\_init\_\_

```python
def __init__(self, n: int, spacetime=None, seed: int = None)
```

Initializes the causal set.

## Examples

```python
import pycauset

# Create a causal set with 1000 elements in 2D Minkowski space
c = pycauset.CausalSet(1000)

# Access the causal matrix (using the alias C)
M = c.C

# Check if element 0 precedes element 10
is_causal = M[0, 10]

# Create a causal set with a specific seed for reproducibility
c_repro = pycauset.Causet(500, seed=42)
print(c_repro.CausalMatrix)
```
