# Dev Handbook (Start Here)

This section is the canonical onboarding path for human contributors and AI agents working on PyCauset.

## What this is

- A **high-signal, low-ambiguity** set of docs describing how the project is structured, how to contribute safely, and what invariants must not be violated.
- Written to support long-running work across many sessions and many AI agents.
