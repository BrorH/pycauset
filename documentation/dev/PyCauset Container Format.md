# PyCauset Container Format (`.pycauset`) — Release 1

This content has moved.

Canonical documentation now lives in:

- [[guides/Storage and Memory]]

Rationale:

- Keep **one** source of truth for the R1 container format, crash-safe updates, and load determinism.
- Avoid drift between “guide” and “dev” pages.
