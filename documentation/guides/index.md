# Guides

These guides show how to use PyCauset in practice, from first setup to large-scale runs.

## Start here

*   **[[guides/Installation|Installation]]**: Install PyCauset (pip or from source).
*   **[[guides/User Guide|User Guide]]**: First workflow: create, visualize, save/load.
*   **[[guides/Causal Sets|Causal Sets]]**: Core object model and common operations.

## Release 1 (what shipped)

*   **[[guides/release1/index.md|Release 1: What Shipped]]**: A guided map of the Release 1 foundations (NxM shapes, storage container, semantic properties, dtype/overflow rules, and core linalg endpoints).

## Common workflows

*   **[[guides/Visualization|Visualization]]**: Creating interactive plots of causal sets.
*   **[[guides/Spacetime|Spacetime]]**: Choosing a spacetime region and sprinkling points.
*   **[[guides/Field Theory|Field Theory]]**: Simulating quantum fields on causal sets.
*   **[[guides/Numpy Integration|NumPy Integration]]**: Interfacing with NumPy arrays.

## Performance and scaling

*   **[[guides/Storage and Memory|Storage and Memory]]**: How PyCauset handles large datasets on disk.
*   **[[guides/Performance Guide|Performance Guide]]**: Tips for optimizing your simulations.

## Linear algebra

*   **[[guides/Matrix Guide|Matrix Guide]]**: Matrix storage, dtypes, and operations.
*   **[[guides/Vector Guide|Vector Guide]]**: Vector storage and operations.
*   **[[guides/Linear Algebra Operations|Linear Algebra Operations]]**: End-to-end linalg workflows (matmul, solves, factorizations, spectral/SVD, routing, warnings).
