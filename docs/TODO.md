# TODO LIST FOR PYCAUSET


Goals:
- [ ] Calculate eq. (3.5) in Johnston: $K = \Phi (I - b\Phi)^^{-1}$ *
- [ ] Calculate a 100GB $K$

## Wanted features
- [ ]  Saving/loading causal matrices to/from binary files.
- [ ]  Implement matrix operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication.
- [ ]  Implement inverting
- [ ] Identity matrix: pycauset.I - it should detect size automatically.
